2024 has been a year of growth and transformation for the lab. Several
long-standing members who've helped to define the atmosphere and approach of the
lab have moved on to exciting new roles and programs, and so we've welcomed
nearly an entire new [team](/team/index.html) of enthusiastic researchers
bringing fresh perspectives and new ideas. Similarly, we're wrapping up three
large research projets that have been central to our lab's work over the last
few years, while starting up three new [projects](/projects/index.html) that
will take us in new directions. 

As part of this turnover, we had to bid a bitterweet goodbye to
[Clara](/team/index.html#Clara-Sanches), who is returning to Europe for another
postdoc that will bring her back closer to family as she grows her own family.
We are all so excited for her and Aurelien and look forward to many updates and
photos. By sheer luck and coincidence, [Rea](/team/index.html#Rea-Antoniou)
turned out to be returning to Europe for her Winter Break on the exact same
flight! So, we got to wish them off with a very American lunch of burgers and
fries before sending them off to the airport. We've still got some
exciting scientific projects to wrap up with Clara even after her postdoc
is officially over, so there will be much more work and personal catching up
over the next few months, but we'll really miss having her in person (while also
acknowledging that her family is very excited to have her back)!
