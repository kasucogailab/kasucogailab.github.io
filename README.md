# KasuCogAI Lab Website

A quick guide for lab members to update and manage the website using GitHub and Markdown. (Site design based on [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).)

## Getting Started
Lab members should be able to:
- [Update their team profile](#how-to-update-or-add-a-team-profile)
- [Update the list of publications](#how-to-update-the-publication-list)
- [Add news posts](#how-to-add-news-posts)

To do this, youâ€™ll need to understand:

### GitHub
GitHub is a version control platform that allows multiple people to work on the same project, track changes, and manage different versions.

### Markdown
This README.md file is written in Markdown, which allows for easy formatting:
- **Bold**: `**bold**`
- *Italics*: `*italics*`
- [Hyperlinks](http://www.example.com): `[text](URL)`

Refer to [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for more details.

### YAML
YAML is a structured data format used for defining content. Example:
```yaml
- name: John Doe
  position: Researcher
  email: john.doe@example.com
```
Ensure proper indentation with spaces (not tabs) and maintain consistency.
