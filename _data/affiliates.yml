  description: I'm a neuroscientist and postdoctoral scholar in the UCSF 
              Movement Disorders and Neuromodulation Center studying motivation 
              in Parkinson's disease with Drs. Simon Little and Phil Starr and 
              neuroethics here in the Decision Lab. 


               In the Little and Starr Labs, our group aims to treat motor and 
               nonmotor (e.g., sleep, cognition, emotion) deficits in patients 
               with Parkinson's disease using neurosurgically implanted deep 
               brain stimulation (DBS) devices. My main research project focuses 
               on understanding apathy and impulsivity symptoms in these 
               patients by (1) measuring goal-directed and habitual decision 
               making with computational reinforcement learning models; 
               (2) mapping these cognitive processes to neural activity using 
               chronic invasive brain recordings; and (3) modulating these 
               neural circuits using dopaminergic medications and DBS. 


               In the Decision Lab, I'm studying bioethics to better understand 
               the ethical, legal, and social implications of neurotechnology. 
               For example, if brain stimulation can alter motivation or other 
               aspects of one's personality and identity, how should we deploy 
               and regulate these treatments? I hope that combining neuroethics 
               with my basic and clinical neuroscience research will help inform 
               guidelines for the responsible use of neurotechnology. 


               I graduated in 2012 from Hendrix College with a BA in 
               Neuroscience before spending two years as a postbaccalaureate 
               researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health working on 
               functional MRI methods. In 2021, I graduated from UC Berkeley 
               with a PhD in Neuroscience in which I studied cognitive control 
               using intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients. 
               Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, hiking, 
               kayaking, and camping.

  description: I am transitioning from a former career as a Ballet dancer to a 
               field of medicine, science, and groundbreaking clinical research. 
               I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Performing Arts Degree in the 
               Liberal Education for Arts Professionals program at Saint Mary’s 
               College of California. Among several extracurricular activities, I also enjoyed 
               being a part of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and the Alpha 
               Gamma Sigma Honor Society.
  
  
               While focusing on my artistry as a ballerina, I enjoyed traveling 
               the world and experiencing unique cultures. In my dance career, 
               I was awarded the Princess Grace Award, a Congressional Black 
               Caucus Foundation’s Performing Arts Medal, and the Chris Hellman 
               Award, among other newspaper and magazine features.
               While I appreciate and value my time in the dance world, I always 
               knew that I would like to go into medicine one day. 
 

               Compassion for our elderly with dementia is a value that is 
               essential in society, so I am incredibly interested in 
               researching and assisting with projects that enhance their 
               quality of life. This is one of many reasons I believe in and 
               value the research at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center.
 
 
               In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, hiking, reading, and Pilates.
